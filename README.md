# Welcome to the Wynnncraft Issue Tracker

## Should I post an issue?
* If your issue is releated to individual payments or account support please email support@wynncraft.com instead of posting the issue here.
* __Pro Tip!__ If you think you've found an exploit, don't post the issue here instead contact support@wynncraft.com 

## Posting an issue
Creating a new issue on the tracker is simple:

1. Head to https://github.com/Wynncraft/Issues/issues/new
2. Give the issue an appropriate title __Powders not working__ instead of __Powders__ - remember specific titles can help use eradicate duplicates on the public and internal issue tracker.
3. Describe the issue with a short summary, followed by steps on how to reproduce the issue - http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax describes the syntax to use for formating. 
4. __Pro Tip!__ Althoug this step is optional it's really helpful when (if possible) you can include a screenshot of the issue that you're describing (drag and drop works).
